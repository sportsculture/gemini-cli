# Task ID: 7
# Title: Fix OpenRouter/DeepSeek Streaming Output Issue
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve the issue where the response is being built character by character, causing repeated text in the streaming output from OpenRouter/DeepSeek API.
# Details:
To address this issue, implement the following steps: 
1. **Review API Request Structure**: Ensure that the API request to OpenRouter/DeepSeek is correctly formatted to handle streaming responses. This may involve setting the `stream` parameter to `true` in the API call, as shown in the DeepSeek API documentation[1]. 
2. **Buffering and Response Handling**: Implement a buffering mechanism to collect the streaming response in chunks rather than processing it character by character. This can be achieved using a library like `async-iterator` in Node.js or similar constructs in other languages. 
3. **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling to detect and log any issues that might cause repeated text, such as network errors or API rate limits. Use logging libraries to track these events for debugging purposes. 
4. **Testing with Different Models**: Test the streaming functionality with various models available through OpenRouter to ensure the fix is model-agnostic. 
5. **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability, ensuring that the streaming logic is modular and easy to update. 

Example code for handling streaming responses in Node.js might look like this: 
```javascript
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';
import axios from 'axios';

const apiStream = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    params: { stream: true },
    responseType: 'stream'
  });

  const chunks = [];
  response.data.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk));
  response.data.on('end', () => {
    const fullResponse = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString();
    console.log(fullResponse);
  });
};
```


# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify that the streaming response is correctly buffered and processed without repeated text. Use mocking libraries to simulate API responses. 
2. **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests with the OpenRouter/DeepSeek API to ensure the fix works in real-world scenarios. Test with different models and edge cases (e.g., network errors). 
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing to visually inspect the output for any issues. 
4. **Performance Testing**: Run performance tests to ensure that the buffering mechanism does not introduce significant latency or memory usage issues.
