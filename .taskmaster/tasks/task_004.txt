# Task ID: 4
# Title: Enable Model Switching and Persistence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Model switching is already implemented: users can switch models mid-session using the /model command, and the model is persisted for the current session via config.setModel(). The UI displays a model change notification. The implementation follows the existing pattern where the model is determined by environment variables. Cross-session persistence (e.g., saving to settings.json) is not implemented, as this would deviate from the current architecture where auth-related settings come from environment variables.
# Details:
No further changes are required for mid-session model switching or session persistence. Cross-session persistence (saving model preference to settings.json) is not implemented to maintain consistency with the current architecture, which relies on environment variables for auth and model configuration. Document this architectural decision and ensure user documentation reflects the current behavior and limitations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that users can switch models mid-session using the /model command and that the selected model persists for the duration of the session. Confirm that the UI displays a notification when the model changes. Automated integration tests should cover these behaviors. No tests are required for cross-session persistence, as it is not supported.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document current model switching and persistence behavior [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update user and developer documentation to clarify that model switching is supported mid-session and persists for the session, but cross-session persistence is not implemented due to architectural constraints.
### Details:


## 2. Add automated integration tests for model switching and session persistence [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure tests cover switching models with /model command, session persistence, and UI notifications. No tests for cross-session persistence are needed.
