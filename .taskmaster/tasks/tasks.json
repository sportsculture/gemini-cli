        "description": "Resolve the issue where the response is being built character by character, causing repeated text in the streaming output from OpenRouter/DeepSeek API.",
        "details": "To address this issue, implement the following steps: \n1. **Review API Request Structure**: Ensure that the API request to OpenRouter/DeepSeek is correctly formatted to handle streaming responses. This may involve setting the `stream` parameter to `true` in the API call, as shown in the DeepSeek API documentation[1]. \n2. **Buffering and Response Handling**: Implement a buffering mechanism to collect the streaming response in chunks rather than processing it character by character. This can be achieved using a library like `async-iterator` in Node.js or similar constructs in other languages. \n3. **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling to detect and log any issues that might cause repeated text, such as network errors or API rate limits. Use logging libraries to track these events for debugging purposes. \n4. **Testing with Different Models**: Test the streaming functionality with various models available through OpenRouter to ensure the fix is model-agnostic. \n5. **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability, ensuring that the streaming logic is modular and easy to update. \n\nExample code for handling streaming responses in Node.js might look like this: \n```javascript\nimport { createReadStream } from 'fs';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nconst apiStream = async () => {\n  const response = await axios.get('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {\n    params: { stream: true },\n    responseType: 'stream'\n  });\n\n  const chunks = [];\n  response.data.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk));\n  response.data.on('end', () => {\n    const fullResponse = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString();\n    console.log(fullResponse);\n  });\n};\n```\n",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify that the streaming response is correctly buffered and processed without repeated text. Use mocking libraries to simulate API responses. \n2. **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests with the OpenRouter/DeepSeek API to ensure the fix works in real-world scenarios. Test with different models and edge cases (e.g., network errors). \n3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing to visually inspect the output for any issues. \n4. **Performance Testing**: Run performance tests to ensure that the buffering mechanism does not introduce significant latency or memory usage issues.",

Review the API responses from OpenRouter/DeepSeek to determine if token usage information is returned (e.g., in response metadata or headers). If the API does not provide token usage directly, implement logic to estimate tokens based on the prompt and completion using a compatible tokenizer (such as tiktoken or a DeepSeek-specific tokenizer). Integrate this logic into the model usage stats pipeline, ensuring that token counts are updated and displayed correctly in the UI and any relevant logs or analytics. If using a third-party analytics or logging tool (e.g., Langfuse), ensure custom model definitions are set up to enable token cost tracking, as described in community discussions and documentation.

        "description": "Resolve the error where 'gemini-2.5-pro' is not recognized as a valid model ID by OpenRouter, and update the default model configuration to use a valid OpenRouter-supported model.",
        "details": "1. **Identify the Issue Location**: Search the codebase for hardcoded references to 'gemini-2.5-pro' model ID, particularly in:\n   - Default configuration files (config.json, .env.example, etc.)\n   - Model selection logic in provider-specific implementations\n   - CLI initialization code where default models are set\n   - Any fallback model configurations\n\n2. **Verify Valid OpenRouter Models**: \n   - Check OpenRouter's API documentation or use their models endpoint to get a list of valid model IDs\n   - Common valid OpenRouter models include: 'openai/gpt-4', 'anthropic/claude-2', 'meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat', 'google/palm-2-chat-bison', etc.\n   - Choose an appropriate default model that balances capability and cost\n\n3. **Update Default Configuration**:\n   - Replace 'gemini-2.5-pro' with a valid OpenRouter model ID (e.g., 'openai/gpt-3.5-turbo' for a cost-effective default)\n   - Ensure the replacement model is consistently available and well-supported\n   - Update any configuration schemas or TypeScript interfaces that define model IDs\n\n4. **Implement Model Validation**:\n   - Add a validation function that checks if a model ID is valid for the selected provider\n   - Consider caching the list of valid models from OpenRouter to avoid repeated API calls\n   - Provide helpful error messages when an invalid model is specified\n\n5. **Update Documentation**:\n   - Update any documentation that references the old default model\n   - Add notes about OpenRouter's model naming convention (provider/model-name format)\n   - Include examples of valid OpenRouter model IDs in configuration documentation\n\n6. **Consider Provider-Specific Defaults**:\n   - Implement a mapping of provider-specific default models\n   - For OpenRouter, use a widely available model like 'openai/gpt-3.5-turbo'\n   - For direct provider connections, use their native model IDs",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Unit Tests for Model Validation**:\n   - Create tests that verify the model validation function correctly identifies valid and invalid OpenRouter model IDs\n   - Test that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid models\n   - Mock the OpenRouter API response for model listing to ensure consistent testing\n\n2. **Integration Tests with OpenRouter**:\n   - Test making actual API calls with the new default model to ensure it works correctly\n   - Verify that the model switch from 'gemini-2.5-pro' to the new default doesn't break existing functionality\n   - Test error handling when an invalid model is specified in configuration\n\n3. **Configuration Tests**:\n   - Verify that the default configuration loads the correct OpenRouter model\n   - Test that environment variable overrides work correctly with the new model ID\n   - Ensure backward compatibility for users who might have custom configurations\n\n4. **CLI Flow Testing**:\n   - Manually test the CLI with OpenRouter provider to ensure no 'invalid model' errors occur\n   - Test model selection flow to verify users can see and select valid OpenRouter models\n   - Verify that helpful error messages appear if users try to use incompatible model IDs\n\n5. **Regression Testing**:\n   - Run the full test suite to ensure the model change doesn't break other functionality\n   - Pay special attention to any tests that might have hardcoded the old model ID\n   - Test with multiple providers to ensure the fix doesn't affect non-OpenRouter providers",
